# oibsip_task3
This project predicts car selling prices using an LSTM model. It preprocesses data with encoding and scaling, reshapes inputs for LSTM, trains a sequential neural network, and evaluates it using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores. It then visualizes actual vs predicted prices with a clear comparison plot.
